			<p>This Project was our first exploration of SQL. There were several taske that needed to be preformed. A database had to be created from csv files. The database had to be planned out by looking at the files and deciding on the structure of the database. To aid in the creation of the database an ERD diagram was also created.

		<div class="para2"> 
			<p> After the database was designed and the scripts to create all the tables, the data was imported. After the data was imported there were several queries that were created in order to pull data from the database and answer certain questions.
